The legislation affects any company or entity that does business with and collects data on European citizens. GDPR prevents companies from using confusing terms to get customers to agree to give a company their data. Within 72 hours of a data breach companies must notify their data protection authority. Customers can ask companies to erase their data at any time. Companies must also put limits on the amount of data they are collecting and how long they are storing it.
