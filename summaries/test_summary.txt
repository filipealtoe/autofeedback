The GDPR is a piece of legislation passed in 2016 to provide more rights to European citizens concerning their data. The legislation affects any company or entity that does business with and collects data on European citizens. GDPR prevents companies from using confusing terms to get customers to agree to give a company their data. Customers must be able to give individual consent to each term. Customers must be able to withdraw consent. Within 72 hours of a data breach companies must notify their data protection authority. Customers must be able to have insight to what data companies are storing about them and what the data is being used for. Customers can ask companies to erase their data at any time. Companies must also put limits on the amount of data they are collecting and how long they are storing it. Companies can suffer consequences for not following the conditions of the legislation. Any entity caught breaching the law could be fined 4 percent of annual global turnover or 20 million euros depending on which has a bigger impact.
