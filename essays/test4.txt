The General Data Protection Regulation is a regulation established by the European Union that focuses on protecting the digital privacy of EU citizens. With the GDPR, EU citizens have the right to request that their personal data no longer be collected, no longer be processed, and even erased. Citizens also have the right to obtain a copy of their personal data. Additionally, companies must request consent from EU citizens in a clear, concise, manner that also clearly indicates how the citizen's data will be used. Although these changes only apply to EU citizens, the jurisdiction of GDPR extends to any
company that processes EU citizen's data, meaning the company need not be in the EU.

GDPR essentially puts EU citizens in control over their data, which means that they have control over their online personalization. However, I believe this imposes an issue for AI, especially in regard to explicit consent; the problem is that there is so much potential for AI that is may be difficult or even impossible to explain all possible ways your data can be used. For example, I bought a new Android smart phone several weeks ago. A few days ago, as I was getting ready to head home from work, I received a traffic notification that there was an accident on the freeway I regularly take home from work, as well as a recommended alternate route. I never explicitly set up this notification, but I do believe this is a feature included by turning location services on. Is it really conceivable to create a consent agreement that clearly explains all of these small details?
