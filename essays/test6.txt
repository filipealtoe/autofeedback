The GDPR allows for the collection and processing of personal data if consent is given from the individual. According to the European Commission, personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. The extent of what processing is allowed is constrained by agreement with the individual. These regulations apply to all companies who work with personal data of a member of the European Union. This mean global companies like Google must comply. Because this change would be easier to roll out to all users rather than a subset, it can be assumed that non-European Union citizens may also see changes from companies using their personal data.

The GDPR regulations directly impact personalized experiences generated from AI.In order for any kind of personalization to take place, the AI agent has to learn from the personal data of the user. Of course, consent must now be given in order for AI to gather and process personal data of any European Union citizen, so AI personalization can still occur. However, it may be difficult for AI agents to clearly and specifically state to the user how they will use their personal data. There are
many varied ways AI use personal data, and the use cases may be too broad to properly ask for consent.
