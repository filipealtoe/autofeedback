The European Union's GDPR, is a recently implemented set of regulations that affect all companies processing personal data of European citizens. As an output of the regulation, organizations are required to share what information they have collected about an individual upon request by that individual, alert regulators of data breaches within 72 hours, and delete an individual's data upon request. Ultimately, it creates a set of principles and guidelines that organizations must follow when collecting data about an individual user.

With regards to the usage of personal data to personalize individual user experiences, GDPR creates friction in the collection of data in many cases, as users will now need to opt-in or agree to the collection which adds a barrier that didn't previously exist. Additionally, it creates a massive burden to organizations, both in technical implementation and cost, to store and manage data if a consumer provides them the appropriate consent. I'm well acquainted with GDPR, as it took a three full 6-week sprints away from my backlog and prioritization list and into satisfying the
requirements necessary to complete the work.

I expect that this will provide larger organizations with an upper-hand to smaller organizations and start-ups that might not have the means to meet the requirements. Organizations must now share what 3rd-party organizations it shares data with, creating transparency and the potential for scrutiny of monetization vehicles. This will likely mean that organizations will be more judicious with the organizations it sells and shares data with making relevant user data used to personalize experiences less easy to come by for smaller organizations who don't generate it on their own. In my estimation, the sum of this regulation has the potential to create an environment where consumers are less open with their data, likely disallowing the wide range of data available today that is used to create the deeply personal Ai and ad-related experiences users have today.
