GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulations, seek to end what many see as clear abuses of individuals' personal data. The most prominent and visible impact of the law to consumers, so far, has been having to agree to the new data privacy policies
all of their favorite websites adopted in response to the EU's legislation. Behind the scenes, though, the impact is much more real. The law compels companies to collect the smallest amount of data possible to meet their ends in fair, transparent manners with the consent of the customer. It also mandates new positions within companies to oversee compliance with the law and requires rapid notification of harmful data breaches.

Depending on how the law is enforced, it could have far reaching implications for the survival and growth of services that leverage artificial intelligence. For instance, the requirement that companies have clear, articulable reasons for collecting each piece of data could clearly impede growth of existing services. For instance, consider an app that collects data about your exercise habits by counting your number of steps. In a strict adherence with this legislation, the app would not be allowed to also collect data on how much you sit still at work, even though the developers might not have much difficulty building the ability to track it. If the developers wanted to track your sitting at work and offer recommendations based on the data, they would have to advertise the service before they started collecting the data. Introducing a feature before its been tested is a major risk for a company. Its risky nature makes the firm less likely to build the feature, slowing down innovation in the marketplace.

As artificial intelligence techniques are researched and developed, their applications are becoming more prevalent. Some firms exist only on the basis of their artificial intelligence-powered technologies that require large amounts of personal data. Take for instance a company called LiveRamp. They are a data onboarding and identity resolution company that helps businesses target specific individuals for advertisements across the internet (Joe, 2015). They leverage AI technologies to
build persistent identities of consumers across their B2B (business-to-business) customers' websites and connect this data to personally identifying information.
