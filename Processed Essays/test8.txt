GDPR impacts personalization of individual user experiences online in multiple ways, primarily through articles defined in Sections 3 and 4. Articles 3.17, 3.18 state that a person can ask to have their personal data deleted and any usages of the data paused. Articles 4.21 and 4.22 state that a person can opt out of all automated profiling and decision making. Keep in mind that pretty much anything that could be used to identify you within a group is, for the purposes of GDPR, considered personal data. This means that the triggering of any of these articles prevents a service from being able to use the person's data for any sort of personalization I can think of. Articles 4.21 and 4.22 especially impact an AI powered service, giving the user the ability to opt out of anything that is not specifically signed off on by a human, effectively rendering an AI useless.

An example of a company affected by the GDPR is 23andMe, which collects a person's genetic data and provides a personalized report analyzing the data based on assorted tests and algorithms. It seems to me that a person's genetic data is the ultimate form of personal data, as they represent the physical blueprint for who you are. In order to start using this service, you have to opt in, or else there simply isn't a service for them to offer. Things start to get trickier after you've started the service and they already have your data. There is no report unless they can personalize it using your data. 23andMe provides a page detailing exactly how they comply with GDPR. In order to do so, they allow users to contact them if they have specific requests for restricting, rectifying, or objecting to the use of data. There are also account settings for opting out of the use of your data in research studies, and for deleting your personal data. They also have detailed documents available on their site that explains how they meet all of their GDPR obligations.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, it's currently not possible to use their genetic profiling services without giving consent and waiving your GDPR rights. It could be possible for them to provide their main service while not retaining any of
their customer's data. This theoretical version of their service would allow you to input your raw genetic data , then run some automated analyses on it, and finally spit back a document that contains some subset of the reports they currently provide. There can also be an option to have a human manually review the report and mail it to you to comply with Article 4.22.
