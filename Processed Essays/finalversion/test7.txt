The GDPR is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. Controllers of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to implement the data protection principles.

Usage of personal data to personalize user experiences online Per GDPR, explicit consent by the data subject is needed to allow businesses to use personal data eg name, email address, ip addresses, home address, social media posts and even use of cookies have to be explicitly approved by the visitor to the online website. It is impossible to personalize online experience without explicit opt-in consent . If the individual exercises her right to be forgotten granted under the regulation, personalization cannot happen even when prior opt-ins are granted. One important aspect of GDPR is that businesses can still personalize the online experience if they have legitimate interest to do so doing only what is necessary and good manners. For eg. an ecommerce website has automatic permission to present personalized offers and products to a visitor in order to maximize conversions and also to complete the sale. But it needs explicit opt-ins to do anything else for eg to subscribe to a mailing list.
