The GDPR became European law on May 25, 2018. It allows users to have more control over their personally identifiable information online; specifically, companies which collect online information on individuals must first obtain their consent. This moves from an opt-out to an opt-in system. Furthermore, individuals have a right to access their information, data breaches must be reported to the country's data protection regulator, and companies over a certain size must hire a data protection officer to ensure compliance with the regulation.

The GDPR has clear implications for companies which sell services personalized by artificial intelligence. For example, for users whose data becomes part of machine learning algorithms or deep learning networks, those users must explicitly consent to having their data collected and used in this way. In the model training process, as much PII as possible should be removed during the analysis - this is in order to protect against unexpected data breaches.

One company for which personalization is the essential service is Facebook. While other social media companies - such as Twitter or LinkedIn - also collect significant PII and offer personalized feeds, they can also offer relatively generic feeds as an alternative. For example, Twitter does not rely on as much PII as Facebook - there is no need to use your real name, and you can select how to tailor your feed by choosing who to follow. LinkedIn requires much more PII, and personalizes its recommendations for who to connect with, but does not use a personalized news feed in the same way as Facebook does to drive engagement.
