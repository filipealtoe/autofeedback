The GDPR allows for the collection and processing of personal data if consent is given from the individual. According to the European Commission personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. These regulations apply to all companies who work with personal data of a member of the European Union. Of course consent must now be given in order for AI to gather and process personal data of any European Union citizen so AI personalization can still occur. However it may be difficult for AI agents to clearly and specifically state to the user how they will use their personal data. There are many varied ways AI use personal data and the use cases may be too broad to properly ask for consent.
