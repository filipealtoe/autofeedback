The intention behind this essay is to create some context about the GDPR that misses concepts included in the generated rubric. This will be used to test the AI algorithms, especially the similarity score. The main goal is to focus the theme of the essay around GDRP, in the effort to full the AI. GDPR is great and needed in the United States also. Hopefully GDPR will be expanded to areas other than Europe. This text includes some weak concepts of GDPR, but misses the intricate relationship between deeper concepts that are characteristic on exemplary essays.

Even though the response focuses on GDPR and include a couple of general ideas about it, the expectation is for the AI rubric generator to assign a low semantic similarity score between it and the generated rubric. This would be the first step towards the expansion of the rubric generation tool into a more general tool to provide feedback on examination essays to students. Note the word GDPR is repeated several times across the response, in the hope it will be assigned as the main concept by the autograder. It also contains some GDPR concepts sprinkled through the response, but in a non-cohesive manner. Concepts like the fact it is focused in Europe and that it is a positive thing that needs to be expanded to other areas.
